ENGO 551 Lab 0 - Website Design Using html, ccs, bootstrap, scss.

My website is designed to display a gardening service for its target audience in a simple interface.

The home screen is a placeholder with a company logo and a few details about our services. 

The navigation tab on top of the screen allows the user to switch between pages. 

The Services tab showcases some of the work that can be requested, with photos. 

The market tab provides a schedule for when fresh produce will be available at the farmers market. 

Finally the contact tab provides the users a form to request a quote for our services, they can enter their name, e-mail address, a description of their property, and the services they require. The form is submitted through the click of a button. 

Below the form there is some general information about the team members working for Golden Boy Gardens, including hyperlinks to our social media pages. 

Thank you for checking out my first website!
